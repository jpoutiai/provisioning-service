The xml tree is assumed to be of the following form:

APPLICATION
-APPID
-ADDR
-TO-PROXY
-TO-NAPID
PXLOGICAL
-PROXY-ID
-PXPHYSICAL
--PXADDR
--TO-NAPID
--PORT
---PORTNBR
NAPDEF
-NAME
-NAP-ADDRTYPE
-NAP-ADDRESS
-INTERNET
-NAPAUTHINFO
--AUTHNAME
--AUTHSECRET

The xml parser first checks if one of the NAPDEF nodes holds property INTERNET
and if so then parses properties from that node to create structure internet.
If no property INTERNET found it checks APPLICATION nodes for property APPID
that has value w2 to find TO-NAPID property which it uses to find matching
NAPDEF node of which properties it uses to create structure w2.

Then the parser checks APPLICATION nodes for property APPID that has value w4 to
find a: property ADDR to be saved in structure w4 b: TO-PROXY property which it
uses to find matching PXLOGICAL node of which it uses subnode PXPHYSICAL to get
a: PXADDR b: PORTNBR from subnode PORT c: TO-NAPID property which it uses to
find matching NAPDEF node of which properties it uses to create the rest of
structure w4.
